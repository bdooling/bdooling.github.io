## ADS-B

I run an ADS-B Feeder that picks up signals from nearby aircraft and feeds the data to ADSB Exchange (https://www.adsbexchange.com/), which aggregates data from contributes onto a [global map]([url](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/)).

Specifically, two antennas (each paired with an SDR) receive and decode ADS-B UAT (978 MHz; for aircraft that operate below 18,000 FT MSL), and ADS-B ES (1090 MHz; above that height).

Aircraft from my feed can be viewed at [https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?feed=9pzsO_x-W0IK]([url](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?feed=9pzsO_x-W0IK)), and stats from my feeder [here]([url](https://www.adsbexchange.com/api/feeders/?feed=9pzsO_x-W0IK)).

Lastly, some additional interesting stats can be viewed on the ADSB Exchange "[leaderboard]([url](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/leaderboard/))" by searching for my feed ID (`9pzsO_x-W0IK`).

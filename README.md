# Bob (Robert) Dooling

## Career in Cybersecurity
* ~25 years experience ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdooling)): Auditor, SOC analyst, PenTester, Incident Responder; NIST, GRC & vCISO consultant.
* Small business owner & operator since 2009.
* Intrinsically motivated to grow skills and share experience in ICS & critical infrastructure security.
* Experience includes network architecture and configuration reviews; IT->OT PenTests; Physical/Social PenTests; War-dialing, and various wireless/RF assessements
* Certifications include: **GICSP**, GAWN, GCFE, GCFW, GCIH, GNFA, GPYC, GSEC, GSNA, GWAPT; **CISSP**; CEH.
* I'm primarily driven by **meaningful work, desire to learn, and diverse experiences** (not pay rate, title, etc).

### Focus on Industrial Control System security:
1. To better understand the pervasive but largely unnoticed systems that enable almost every facet of modern life.
2. To protect lives, and societal well-being.
3. To encourage kids' interest in cybersecurity  (physical processes are tangible, and have clear implications).

## Ham Radio / RF Hobby

Amateur radio license holder; call sign [W2HIP](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=5240183).

I learn something new about this fascinating field every week, and will never run out of opportunities to learn more.

Along with my kids, we experiment with a few different radio and antenna combinations to collect radio signals from places near and far (literally around the world)!

#### ADS-B

I run an ADS-B Feeder that picks up signals from nearby aircraft and feeds the data to [ADSB Exchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com/), which aggregates data from contributes onto a [global map](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/).

Specifically, two antennas (each paired with an SDR) receive and decode ADS-B UAT (978 MHz; for aircraft that operate below 18,000 FT MSL), and ADS-B ES (1090 MHz; above that height).

Aircraft from my feed can be viewed at [https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?feed=9pzsO_x-W0IK](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?feed=9pzsO_x-W0IK), and stats from my feeder [here](https://www.adsbexchange.com/api/feeders/?feed=9pzsO_x-W0IK).

Some additional stats can be viewed on the ADSB Exchange "[leaderboard](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/leaderboard/)" by searching for my feed ID (`9pzsO_x-W0IK`).

#### FT8

Our most recent activity with this "weak signal" digital mode can be seen at the [PSKReporter site](https://www.pskreporter.info/pskmap?preset&callsign=W2HIP&timerange=86400) (note: some days we're quiet / offline), while a comprehensive list of countries/territories we've received contacts from is maintained [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bdooling/public_gh_content/refs/heads/master/rf/pskreporter-combined-unique.txt).

## Other Avocations

### Mapping
I contribute (modestly) to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about). [My efforts](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/RDDMD/history) focus mostly on local & regional infrastructure systems - which are also fed into [OpenInfraMap](https://openinframap.org/about), a very cool project to visualize the infrastructure that is hidden in plain sight all around us ([for example](https://openinframap.org/#11.84/39.26185/-76.69132)).

### Farming

I help out on our family's small farm in western Maryland - enjoying time outside, physical labor, and developing some entirely new skills.
